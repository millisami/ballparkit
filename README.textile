h1. "It's just a ballpark figure"

Ballpark is a tool that allows developers to estimate programming and/or design gigs. The idea is to give potential clients a summary of the project breakdown, where the expensive parts live, and so on.

But most importantly, it's a way for you to justify why you're charging so much :-)

h2. Getting Started in Development mode
