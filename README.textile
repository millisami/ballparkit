h1. "It's just a ballpark figure"

Ballpark is a tool that allows developers to estimate programming and/or design gigs. The idea is to give potential clients a summary of the project breakdown, where the expensive parts live, and so on.

But most importantly, it's a way for you to justify why you're charging so much :-)

h2. Getting Started in Development mode

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/rpheath/ballparkit.git</code></pre>

From the project root...

<pre><code>mv database.yml.example database.yml</code></pre>

_(configure database.yml)_

<pre><code>rake gems:install
rake db:create:all
rake db:schema:load
rake db:test:prepare
rake tests:run
</code></pre>

_(ensure tests pass)_

<pre><code>script/server</code></pre>
