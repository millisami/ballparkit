h1. "It's just a ballpark figure"

Ballpark is a tool that allows developers to estimate programming and/or design gigs. The idea is to give potential clients a summary of the project breakdown, so you can justify why you're charging so much :-)

h2. Getting Started

From the project root...

* mv database.yml.example database.yml
* rake db:create:all
* rake db:schema:load

h2. License

Ballpark is completely open-source. Fork it. Host it. Enjoy it.
