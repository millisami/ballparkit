h1. "It's just a ballpark figure"

Ballpark is a tool that allows developers to estimate programming and/or design gigs. The idea is to give potential clients a summary of the project breakdown, where the expensive parts live, and so on.

But most importantly, it's a way for you to justify why you're charging so much :-)

h2. Getting Started

From the project root...

* mv database.yml.example database.yml
* _(configure database.yml)_
* rake gems:install
* rake db:create:all
* rake db:schema:load
* rake db:test:prepare
* rake tests:run
* _(ensure tests pass)_
* script/server

h2. License

Ballpark is completely open-source. Fork it. Host it. Enjoy it.
